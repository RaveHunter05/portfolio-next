          Iâ€™m a full stack web developer who can build apps from the ground up.
          Iâ€™ve worked mostly at startups so I am use to wearing many hats. I am
          a very product focussed developer who priotizes user feedback first
          and foremost. Iâ€™m generally very flexible when investigating new
          roles.
